#  Brain Tumor Detection 

This is a deep learning project built to check for the presence of a brain tumor in MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It performs  classification (tumor / no tumor) .

##  Features

- Detects presence of brain tumor from MRI scans
- CNN model implemented using TensorFlow/Keras
- Simple preprocessing and training pipeline
- Prediction script for testing on new images

##  Dataset

The dataset consists of two classes:
- `yes`  Images with brain tumors
- `no`  Images without brain tumors

 Dataset source: Kaggle
